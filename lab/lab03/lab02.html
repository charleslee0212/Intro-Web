          <h3>What is a Goose?</h3>
          <pre>
    A goose (plural geese) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.
    his group comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese), Branta (the black geese), and Chen
    (which includes the white geese);the latter being commonly placed within the genus Anser.
    Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names. More
    distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true
    geese, and ducks, which are smaller.

    The term "goose" is more properly used for a female bird, while "gander" refers specifically
    to a male one. Young birds before fledging are called goslings.[1] The collective noun for a
    group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or
    a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump.[2]

          <h3>True geese &amp their relatives</h3>
          <pre>
    The three living genera of true geese are: Anser, grey geese, including the greylag goose,
    and domestic geese; Chen, white geese (often included in Anser);and Branta, black geese,
    such as the Canada goose. Two genera of geese are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae;
    they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: Cereopsis, the Cape Barren
    goose, and Cnemiornis, the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably,
    the goose-like Coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese. Fossils of
    true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record,
    particularly in North America, is dense and comprehensively documents many different species
    of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the Miocene. The aptly
    named Anser atavus (meaning "progenitor goose") from some 12 million years ago had even more
    plesiomorphies in common with swans. In addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil
    remains found on the Hawaiian Islands. Geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout
    the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only
    during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that
    result in more young.[4]
