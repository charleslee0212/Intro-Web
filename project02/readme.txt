bedtime

this website is to entertain children while they are getting ready to sleep. Parents can read short children
stories to their children. this website provides six stories the parents can choose from. if the parents cannot choose,
there is also a random tab they can interact with which randomly picks a story from the six stories.

i have implemented html, css, and javascript in my website. the stories tab allows parents to click on the book covers
and a modal pops up to display the story.
